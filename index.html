        <h6>Tennis is favorite sport team</h6>
        <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually
           against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of 
           two players each (doubles). <b>Each player uses a tennis racket 
           that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball</b> covered 
           with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. 
           The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way 
           that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.
           <b>The player who is unable to return the ball </b>validly will not 
           gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>
