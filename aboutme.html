                Rich Dad Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and
                his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and the 
                father of his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways 
                in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing.
                You don’t need to earn a high income to be rich.
